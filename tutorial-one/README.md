# tutorial-one

For whatever reason I've decided to implement the openGL tutorial you see [here](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-1-opening-a-window/) in Haskell.

As a way of playing with both things.

This is tutorial one - it doesn't do much - creates a window, sets up the escape key so that it closes that window, and shuts everything down.
